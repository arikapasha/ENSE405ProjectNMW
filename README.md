# No More Waste

## UN SDG Focus

The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal I am focusing on is goal #2: Zero Hunger.
 
## Project Idea

The NoMoreWaste app is similar to any fast food delivery app (UberEats, SkipTheDishes, DoorDash), however, it is based on donations of food and volunteer drivers. Businesses in the food industry, at the end of the day, are able to request someone to pick up their leftover food that did not sell and have that driver drop it off to a shelter to ensure that our homeless population in Regina is not starving. 

## Project Background/Business Opportunity

During my summers in high school, I used to work in food services at an amusement park in Calgary and, at the end of the day, they would make us throw away all the food that we did not sell. Every single day the park was throwing away hundreds of donuts, thousands of fries, hotdogs, burgers, churros, and anything else it did not sell that day. My coworkers and I felt terrible every time we had to throw the perfectly good food in the trash and even told our supervisors that this food could be donated to shelters for the homeless in our city, but they always refused.  

This is something that is extremely common in restaurants and fast food places as well, they will throw the remaining food away at the end of the day when it could have been eaten by someone who may have needed it. Either these managers are not aware that shelters are willing to accept food donations or they are not willing to drive out of their way to drop it off. With NoMoreWaste, they can easily request a volunteer driver to pick up their food and drop it off at whatever shelters are open or accepting, with the shelter confirming with the restaurant that the food was received. Not only does this allow the business to help our local community here in Regina, but it also allows the volunteer drivers to help make a difference in people's lives. 

This is extremely important, especially in the winter time, where around 286 homeless people may not even have a single meal every day. Instead of that food going to waste, it could help someone out significantly.
